        We need to start finding from the number 7. This is very natural to think.
        The index of 7 is what we want to get using Binary Search. 
        After that, we need to compute how many numbers are missing before 7, that is, 7 - 3(index of 7) - 1 = 3. 
        So the left missing number is 5 - 3 = 2.

        the case of crossing border. But the side effect is that, after Binary Search, either left or right can be the result both. 
        So we need to judge after while loop. Although this is a side effect, but it is like a template when we judge it at last. 
        So I can say, the benefit > side effect when
        we use left + 1 < right. Otherwise, writing left <= right or left < right will make you confused in many problems.

    33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
    Medium
    There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

    Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) 
    such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). 
    For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
    Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
    You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. 
    
    The approach is simple if we are able to find the index from where the given array is rotated. We can follow below steps to solve this problem â€”
    Find the index where the array is rotated. Notice if a sorted array is rotated then the rightmost element will not be the biggest element in the array.
    Using the information in step #1, we can perform binary search to find the index where the array is rotated.
    Once we have found that index, then we can easily determine in which half (array will be divided into two halves by the pivot index) of the array 
    the target lies.
    Notice, the two halves are themselves will be sorted (this is pretty intuitive, right ðŸ˜„?).
    We can then perform binary search once again in the determined half to find the index of the target element.

    153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
    Medium
    Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

    [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
    [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
    Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
    Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
    
    keywords sorted and O(log n) compels for a binary search, there's the twist of rotation
    
    find the pivot, find the element that breaks the order
    assuming mid is the minimum, lhs and rhs should be (at least partially) sorted: should we search left or right?
    when you rotate you put larger values on lhs
    if nums[mid] >= nums[0] thenm mid is part of the left sorted portion, which means we want to search to the right (= is edge case when mid==0)
    vice versa if nums[mid] <= nums[n-1], you want to search to the left
    this works only if rotated: if we get to a complete4ly sorted polrtion, we just take the leftmost value
    
    if nums[left] < nums[right] the portion is already sorted, you just take the leftmost and you are done
