        Really look at the problem
        It's min_{0<=i<=n-d} max_{i<=j<=i+d} a_j
        Instead of nested min max you keep a sliding window updating max and min in one run O(n)
        Textbook example really!!!
        
        Consider an -integer sequence, . We perform a query on  by using an integer, , to calculate the result of the following expression:
        In other words, if we let , then you need to calculate .

        Given  and  queries, return a list of answers to each query.
        Example

        The first query uses all of the subarrays of length : . The maxima of the subarrays are . The minimum of these is .

        The second query uses all of the subarrays of length : . The maxima of the subarrays are . The minimum of these is .

        Return .

    3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
    Medium
    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
    Are you thinking what I am thinking ðŸ¤”? Yes, this is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using the legendary technique - Sliding Window Algorithm.

    Following are the steps that we will follow -

    Have two pointers which will define the starting index start and ending index end of the current window. Both will be 0 at the beginning.
    Declare a Set that will store all the unique characters that we have encountered.
    Declare a variable maxLength that will keep track of the length of the longest valid substring.
    Scan the string from left to right one character at a time.
    If the character has not encountered before i.e., not present in the Set the we will add it and increment the end index. The maxLength will be the maximum of Set.size() and existing maxLength.
    If the character has encounter before, i.e., present in the Set, we will increment the start and we will remove the character at start index of the string.
    Steps #5 and #6 are moving the window.
    After the loop terminates, return maxLength

    # sliding window technique
    n   = len(s)

    while i <= j and j < n:
