        For a given binary number, multiplying by 2 is the same as adding a zero at the end 
        (just as we just add a zero when multiplying by ten in base 10).
        Since multiplying by 2 just adds a zero, then any number and its double will have the same number of 1's. 
        Likewise, doubling a number and adding one will increase the count by exactly 1. Or:

        with an extra one if it's an odd number. We iterate through the range of numbers 
        and calculate each bit count successively in this manner:

	29. Divide Two Integers
	Medium
	Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
	The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, 
	and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.
	Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
	Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’231, 231 âˆ’ 1]. 
	For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.    

	How can we improve this ðŸ¤”? What if instead of decreasing the dividend linearly, we decrease it exponentially? 
	This will definitely improve the performance drastically.

	We can follow the below steps â€”

	A variable quotient will keep the track of answer.
	A while loop will check the condition dividend >= divisor
	Inside this while loop, we will have one variable shift which will left shift the divisor by one bit and check if the result is less than the dividend. This will repeat until the condition is false.
	Once, we are out of inner loop, then we will add the number of times we shifted to the quotient.
	Also, we will now subtract the result of shifting to divisor from the dividend for the next iteration. Remember that since in the while loop the value of shifting had gone beyond the dividend, the value we need to subtract is one bit less shifted.
	We will repeat the process unless we reach to the point where divisor is greater than dividend.
	You must be wondering that why are we shifting the bits? The answer is, one left shift bit means the number is doubled. And since we cannot use multiplication, we are using left shifting.

	x << y
	Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (and new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). This is the same as multiplying x by 2**y.
	x >> y
	Returns x with the bits shifted to the right by y places. This is the same as //'ing x by 2**y.
