        43. Multiply Strings
        Medium
        Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
        Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
        
        So this isnâ€™t a very difficult problem, but if you just do the regular multiplication, you can figure it out. Figure below:
        The basic idea is as follows:
        (1) can first flip the string, that is, start from the low order calculation.
        (2) use an array to maintain the final result, updating it every time you multiply it, but pay attention to the carry case () pay attention 
            to the two  points, the same bit to add the carry, from low to high multiplication is carried. )
        (3) finally, the 0 in front of the array is discarded and converted to string output.

        806. Number of Lines To Write String
        Easy
        You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an array widths denoting how many pixels wide each lowercase English letter is. 
        Specifically, widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', and so on.

        You are trying to write s across several lines, where each line is no longer than 100 pixels. 
        Starting at the beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels. 
        Then, from where you stopped in s, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of s.

        Return an array result of length 2 where:

        result[0] is the total number of lines.
        result[1] is the width of the last line in pixels.
