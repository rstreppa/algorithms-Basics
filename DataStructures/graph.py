            The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles (a node may be visited twice). 
            To avoid processing a node more than once, use a boolean visited array. 
            The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) 
            and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 
            So the basic idea is to start from the root or any arbitrary node and mark the node 
            and move to the adjacent unmarked node and continue this loop until there is no unmarked adjacent node. 
            Then backtrack and check for other unmarked nodes and traverse them. Finally, print the nodes in the path.

        Add a new friendship relation, i.e., a person x becomes friend of another person y.
        Find whether individual x is a friend of individual y (direct or indirect friend)

        Example:
        
        We are given 10 individuals say,
        a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j

        a <-> b

        c <-> i
        j <-> e
        g <-> j
        
        And given queries like whether a is a friend of d
        or not.

        Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.
        The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).
